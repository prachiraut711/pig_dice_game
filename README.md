Game Objective:
Players take turns rolling a dice (values 1 to 6).
If they roll a 1, they lose all points for that turn and the turn ends.
If they roll 2â€“6, the value adds to their current turn score.
They can keep rolling or stop at any time (by not pressing 'y').
After they stop, their current turn score is added to their total score.
First player to reach or exceed 50 points wins.
